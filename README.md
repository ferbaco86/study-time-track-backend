# Study-Time-Track-App: Backend

> Study Time Track App Backend is a back-end API, which provides data to the [Study-Time-Track-Frontend](https://github.com/ferbaco86/study-time-track-frontend) which is an app that allows the user to register the time he/she spends on a given task. 


## Main Features

* It allows the users to register and log in using a username and password.

* Authorization managed with JWT token so the user session persists. 

* The user can create a study session and add study subjects and the time she/he spent studying it to that particular session.

* The user can check each session.

* The user can get the latest and longest sessions, and top 5 most studied subjects.
